## Project

Use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to write a small single page web application with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or the Context API. We know there is not a lot of state in this application, but rigging up a state management library gives us a good sense of your style.

If you are not a fan of React and/or prefer an alternative web framework. No problem! We use React and enjoy it, but you don't have to be right now. Feel free to use Vue, Angular, etc or even plain JS as long as you accomplish the requirements below. However, if you do use React, use Create React App with some state management library.

### Requirements

* Has a single button in the center called "Current Weather.
* Upon click, it uses the built-in browser [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the user's location
* The application then grabs the current weather for that location from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) and displays it on the page

Styling is not the primary goal here, but it's not a large UI so try to make it look decent. We're primarily looking at your ability to write clean organized code, interact with external APIs, and handle asynchronous JavaScript. Your commit history should clearly show your progression through the application.
